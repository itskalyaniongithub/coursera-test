		It is indeed rare for the world to witness a leader that is intelligent, wise, selfless and loved by all. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was one such leader. Furthermore, he was a man who has a very strong appeal among the masses. Moreover, his political stature is way above the discriminatory lines of caste and religion.
		APJ Abdul Kalam Speech
	
		Saying that Indian people love APJ Abdul Kalam would be a massive understatement. The Indian people have a huge affection for this man. Consequently, he was known as the People’s President. The man had to face only a few critics his entire life.
		
		The entire nation reacted to his death with grief. Kalam was a great asset to India. His unparalleled contributions in the field of science took India to new heights. Kalam’s presidency was characterized by peace and efficiency.
		Leaders keep on coming and going. Every once in awhile, we come across someone as pre-eminent as Kalam. His name will certainly go down in history as one of the greatest presidents that India has ever seen. Moreover, people will also remember him as a brilliant scientist. The man was a precious gem for each and every Indian.
		Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈəbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
		

		Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

		While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]
